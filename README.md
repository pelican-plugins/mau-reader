Mau Reader is a Pelican plugin that converts the [Mau](https://github.com/Project-Mau/mau) format into HTML.

## Requirements

This plugin requires:

* Python 3.8+
* Pelican 4.5+
* Mau 2.0+

## Installation

This plugin can be installed via the following command, which will also automatically install Mau itself:

    python -m pip install pelican-mau-reader

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `mau_reader` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

## Usage

The plugin automatically manages all Pelican content files ending with the extension: `.mau`

Metadata shall be expressed as Mau variables under the `pelican` namespace. For example:

```
:pelican.title:Test Mau file with content
:pelican.date:2021-02-17 13:00:00
:pelican.modified:2021-02-17 14:00:00
:pelican.category:test
:pelican.tags:foo, bar, foobar
:pelican.summary:I have a lot to test
```

The value of a metadata field is a string, just as it is in the standard Markdown format. Please note that Mau variable values include all characters after the colon, spaces included.

All values in the `config` dictionary are available as variables, so you can specify global values that are valid for all documents.

## Custom templates

You can override some or all Mau default HTML templates via the `custom_templates` configuration variable. For example, should you want to add a permanent link to all headers you can define:

``` python
MAU = {
    "custom_templates": {
        "header.html": (
            '<h{{ level }} id="{{ anchor }}">'
            "{{ value }}"
            '<a href="#{{ anchor }}" title="Permanent link">¶</a>'
            "</h{{ level }}>"
        )
    }
}
```

… and if you want to limit that to only headers of level 1 and 2 you can use:

``` python
MAU = {
    "custom_templates": {
        "header.html": (
            '<h{{ level }} id="{{ anchor }}">'
            "{{ value }}"
            '{% if level <= 2 %}<a href="#{{ anchor }}" title="Permanent link">¶</a>{% endif %}'
            "</h{{ level }}>"
        )
    }
}
```

## Table of contents and footnotes

The TOC (Table of Contents) and footnotes are specific to each content file and can be inserted as usual with the Mau commands `::toc:` and `::footnotes:`.

## Custom header anchors

Mau provides a simple function to compute IDs for headers, based on the content. The current function is:

``` python
def header_anchor(text, level):
    # Everything lowercase
    sanitised_text = text.lower()

    # Get only letters, numbers, dashes, and spaces
    sanitised_text = "".join(re.findall("[a-z0-9- ]+", sanitised_text))

    # Remove multiple spaces
    sanitised_text = "-".join(sanitised_text.split())

    return sanitised_text
```

This provides deterministic header IDs that should suit the majority of cases. Should you need something different, you can provide your own function specifying `mau.header_anchor_function` in the configuration:

``` python
MAU = {
    "mau.header_anchor_function": lambda text, level: "XYZ",
}
```

The example above returns the ID `XYZ` for all headers (not recommended as it is not unique). The arguments `text` and `level` are respectively the text of the header itself and an integer representing the level of depth (e.g., `1` for `h1` headers, `2` for `h2` headers, and so on).
